#3rd Year Dissertation Project Proposal

###Project Title:  Detecting Fake news within a Social Networking App 

####Introduction

The aim of the project is to create a social network that solves, current issues facing existing social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. In terms of what makes this social networking app different from others, is that it will have a clean user interface that takes into account HCI principles. The theme of the social networking site will be based around allowing people to created shared interests groups, in which they can chat with each other about their particular interests. For example, there may be a sports group, a music group or a technology group. 

Furthermore, in recent times, social networks have been overwhelmed with vast amounts of data, as a result of this, there is a need for such a system that is able to sort this data and provide only the most relevant information. The first idea is to have a web page ranking system, that lets users vote on the most useful web link out of series that have been posted on the social networking app by the user.

The most recently talked about topic regarding social media is fake news. Part of the project will involve tackling this issue, by letting users mark a news article as fake, then based on the average response of the user, the article will be accordingly given a negative rating so that the fake news is prevented from reappearing on the webpage. There may also be an artificial intelligence feature to the social networking app that recommends friends based on particular interests.
